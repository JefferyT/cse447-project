Elon Musk is a genious, hopefully he is successful with his colonisation plan, he is also an actor you know
I didn’t know that.  I knew he co founded paypal but I had no idea he acted as well.
Yeah apparently he acted in a thank you for smoking sketch, and his wife is an actress as well she was in the movie Inception
Impressive.  I like that he is into solar energy.  He inspired a solar company and now it’s part of Tesla.
He is looking into the future that is for sure, he also wanted to build a vertical take off jet for passangers.
That would be different. I wonder if it would have benefits that the normal way doesn’t.  You know he thinks outside the box.  When he wants to do something he just does it, like shooting a cheese wheel into space.
That is an absurd way to waste money lol, shooting a cheese wheel into space! amazing but at the same time wasteful.
If you got it why not?  He is worth over 20 billion dollars after all.
Yeah I guess so, just seems like a waste with all the poor families and kids without homes in the world, to think Musk was born in 1971, he sure has taken advantage of his time on earth
He really has.  I think he can be inspiring.  I can see how it could be wasteful to spend money like that but on the other hand he shows people to just do what they want with what they have.  It’s a lot like Galileo back in the day building a telescope.  To me it’s a way to say give your imagination free reign and try stuff.  Tesla is an electronic car company that he founded in the day and age where the big automakers dominate but he is giving it a try.
Yeah I guess his contributions to socitety are bigger, one day he will be remembered as Galileo and other historic figures.
Have you ever seen the movie Snowden
Not yet. I know that’s about the whistle blower who escaped to Russia, right? 
Yeah founder of Wikileaks. You know they published the government’s plans to destroy them. 
That’s right. I forgot that he found Wikileaks also. I didn’t know that, but I recently learned that the government owns 86% of NV land.
That’s a lot of land to be own by the government, what’s their game plan, lol
Maybe Snowden knows! Apparently governments are to abide by governing principles that are to balance individual freedom and tyranny.
Yeah sounds suspect. In 2006, the us passed legislation that would protect government employees from being prosecuted for violating the Geneva conventions
Also sounds suspect. Did you know that Albert Einstein was asked to be Israel’s president? But he declined.
That’s deep. Franklin D. Roosevelt tried to invite Albert Einstein to the White House. 
Yeah, and the letter was intercepted and then the invitation was declined by Flexner.
Sounds like another administration i can think of. 
Einstein was very involved in American politics. To this day, his estate earns $18 million annually.
He was born in Germany right?
Yes, but he was very worldly. He was also a member of the NAACP and he charged $1 for his autograph. All of that collected money was donated to charities.
Well that doesn’t sound too bad. This is strange though Albert einstein wrote a quote in 1938 and placed it in a time capsule to be opened in 6939.
6939. I wonder why so far into the future. He was a scientist and developed the theory of relativity so maybe he saw something happening in this distant future.
Maybe, thats too far in the future for me. It was not until the 19th century that the term scientist came into regular use after it was coined by the theologian, philosopher, and historian of science William Whewell in 1833. 
Just a little too far ha-ha. And natural philosophy was a precursor of natural science.
They say that Harrison schmitt was the only scientist to walk on the moon.
Einstein would have been in all his glory if he had the chance. And it would have been well deserved since he wrote to Roosevelt about uranium being turned into bombs.
Yeah he did a lot more than what he’s best known for  mass energy equivalence formula E = mc2
Eureka! He sure did. But anyway, I enjoyed our chat! It was very informative. I hope you have a great evening.
you too!
Take care!
Are you a science fan? did you know that the estate of Einstein earns more that 18,000,000 a year? Pretty amazing inventor!
I do love science. There is so many cool things to explore such as computers or chemistry. 
Did you know that Albert Einstein was born in Germany and is best known for for his equation E= mc2?
I did know that. I find it intersting he wrote to Roosevelt about nuclear energy so long ago. We tend to think of it as a modern thing beyond the A bomb
It seems ironic that scientist put men on the moon but Harrison Schmitt was the only one to actually walk on the moon.
I think astronauts need a different temperment than someone who works in a lab or engineering. There has to be a sense of thrill seeking that seems to be lacking in a lot of scientists. 
So true. The world wide web was invented in 1989 by and english scientist working in Switzerland for a state funded research organization. . .How much it changed the world!
It really has! I think it has impacted our economy and countries in ways that are unimaginable. I wonder if they knew what they were inventing when they did it.
I am sure they had no idea! There were two geniuses that invented things without thought of how they were to be used Hertz and Maxwell.  Had this thought that curiosity shoud drive invention
I think curiousity is a great thing. The internet sure has helped with that. Imagine the information we have access to now that generations past had so much trouble accessing. 
So often only governments and universities can fund the research for projects in science without an immediate need. It is kind of like an essay in Harpers magazine in 1939 titled "The usefulness of Useless Knowledge.
If only that money was put to better use.
It is a bit like the scientist Hertz that worked out electromagnetism. Macaroni, did very little of the science but he was credited with inventing radio! 
I think the pointless project funding goes back to entitlement spending. People start to think they can spend just because they want to. 
I think that was on the tails of the industrial revolution. I think that know with spending out of control only endowed universities have the luxury of funding research without a product goal.
The problems lie in the facts that it is doing nothing but driving us deeper into debt as federal funding goes to these pointless projects that are driven in the name of research for research’s sake and has no practical value. 
That is so true now. In the days of the 30s, 40s, and fifties, the inventions such as dishwashers, air conditioners, and fax machines would drive the economy up.
I think if we were to address the cost of inflation and the realities of what our government has done to the economy vs what other countries are doing we would be in a better place as a nation in america. 
I don’t think that we would have the luxuries in our homes and lives that we have now without scientist. as a sidenote, did you know that Einstein answered his own mail? 
I could see that. He seemed like a very down to earth man for how brilliant he was. 
That he could do that and earn the Nobel Prize for Physics shows that he was somewhat down to earth.
He was a brilliant and kind man who impacted the science community in so many ways. 
Hello, do you follow the government?
A little bit, they own almost all of Nevada. 
Yep, they own 86% of the state which is crazy.
They did test a lot of nuclear bombs there, so I don’t think anyone would want those areas. 
Very good point. Did you know Wikileaks published the government’s plan to shutdown Wikileaks?
No, but it is seems logical given the nature of government and Wikileak’s nature to publish them.  
True. A man in France once impersonated a government official and was able to sell the Eiffel Tower twice. 
Yeah, I feel a little bad for the people that fell for it, especially the first one, he was so ashamed that he did not called to police. 
Me too. The Norwegian government once gave $1 billion to help save the Amazon rainforest. 
Do you think they will succeed ? I hope so. 
I hope so too. Do you know much about Einstein?
I know he was a scientist. Is he German ?
Yep, he was German. He was once asked to be the president of Israel. 
Why would they ask him to be president of Israel ? He must have made a ton of money with all those posters with his face. 
Not really sure. I also saw he was a member of the NAACP.
So he was actively for civics right, he seems a good man but a quirky one I have heard that he wrote something and put it is a time capsule that will be opened in 6939.  
He was a good man and very smart. That’s cool about the time capsule. Did you know he would charge $1 for his autograph?
That is a lot for the time, what did he do with the money ?
Not really sure lol. Seems a little bizarre. It was good chatting with you!
Good, but there are other interesting scientists to talk about like the emperor of Japan who is also a scientist. 
That’s good. Take care!
How do you think our government is doing?
Hi, I think they are doing pretty good right now. What do you think?
I think so too, lots of drama with it, but as long as they are doing their job I am fine with it
For sure. I saw Wikileaks once published the government’s plan to shutdown Wikileaks.
that is awesome, that is really sticking it to the man. I wonder if they released why 86% of Nevada is owned by the government
That’s a lot of Nevada they own. I bet there are tons of secret bases and things like that out there.
I am sure there has to be. It is all desert, but I am sure they are doing some crazy things there
I bet they are. In 2008, the Norwegian government donated $1 billion to help save the Amazon rainforest. 
Wow, that is something! I wish we did that but I think we donate billions already to other countries with aid. 
Yes we do donate a lot. A man in France once impersonated a government official and was able to sell the Eiffel Tower twice
that is awesome! not once, but twice! Someone had to have gotten fired over it lol
I agree. Do you know much about Einstein?
I know he was some super smart guy and scientist. I think his estate gets a ton of money still
He was very smart. Looks like his estate gets $18,000,000 annually. 
wow that is a ton of money, literally! I wonder what for. I am sure he has a ton of patents
I bet. Einstein was a member of the NAACP.
that is awesome, he didn’t discriminate. He lived during those times. I think he was asked to be the president of Israel also once
That’s pretty cool. Did you know he charged $1 for his autograph?
that is awesome! I hope he donated the money to charity or something. It was nice chatting with you!
It was good chatting with you too. Did you know the emperor of Japan is a scientist as well?
wow that is pretty crazy stuff! What a smart dude! Enjoy your day!
Hi there! Do you think voting is important?
No today i don’t, sorry i think it’s all rigged.What about you? 
Yeah, sadly, I feel the same. Maybe the system still needs to be developed. Up until 1918 not all men in UK had the vote.
Right i heard that. Did you know astronauts get to vote from space? 
Neat! And in India they even set up a voting booth for one voter in area saturated with lions.
Guess they did want him to vote. That sounds unusually cruel. 
I wonder if in India they vote what to name their garbage dumps. In Austin, Texas they voted to name theirs after Fred Durst.
Wow that is to funny, i wonder why? Another unfortunate fact is that 34% of black males will never have the chance to vote
That’s sad. And a lot of eligible voters do not show up. The turnout for presidential elections has not reached 63 percent in the last 100 years.
Right! heres an interesting fact since 1900 the taller candidate has always won.
Wow! So officials in Ancient Athens were appointed by lottery. They thought elections would cause oligarchy. And knowing the fact you just told me doesn’t make me have faith in the system either!
It’ supposed to be a formal group decision making process by which a population chooses an individual to hold public office. We know it;s not. 
Do you think they should add a none of these candidates voting option for all elections?
I’m on the fence about that. I know Nevada has it but i wonder what the benefits are beside knowing who voted and who didn’t.
Yeah, there needs to be electoral reform, so that fair electorial systems are put in place.
Right i’m with you. Did you know that one of the moons of Jupiter would be considered a planet if it orbited the sun?
Wow. Speaking of planets, I was sad when Pluto was deemed not a planet! I grew up being taught that it was!
I know and then all of a sudden right! I hear they discovered building block for life some 455 light years away. I wonder how? 
Yeah, I’m not sure. And I always thought planets spun in a similar manner. Venus doesn’t tilt so it has no seasons, and it also rotates clock wise unlike other planets.
Wow! Hey there a five planets in our solar system that can be seen with the naked eye.
Cool, I want to go out right now and see how many I can spot. Have a good night!
Planets are pretty crazy if  you think about it
Yes, they are. I am crazy enough to appreciate them though. What interesting facts about planets do you know?
Jupiter’s moon ganymede would be a planet if it orbited the sun, do you know any?
I have heard that some planets dont have a tilted axis, and others spin on their SIDE. crazy, huh?
wow, very crazy, what would earth be like spinning on its side lol. I heard Uranus rolls around the sun
URANUS? <chuckle> What a name! Yes, i wonder what is wrong with that planet besides its awkward name.
Right lol! imagine a planet where shards of glass precipitate sideways at you, that is a real thing
that sounds like a terrible vacation. i would rather go that planet 455 light years away.
right, I heard about that planet, it can possible sustain life right?
It might. we should get Elon to get some people headed toward the thing.
Right, that could be his next venture. You think we will see a man on mars in our lifetime?
Yes, we will, but how long can they be there? and what can they do that a probe cant? 
That is a valid point, I am glad someone is spending money on it. Do you think the Space Force will patrol it lol?
Um, i dont know about the Space Force. Maybe? THe govt has 22 trillion in debt. it is not a popular idea at the moment. 
I think our elected president will push it like the wall, are you a fan of him?
I am not really a trump fan. the wall is going to be in the next budget. about 8 billion. i think that the 2020 election is going to be interesting.
I think so too, I wonder who he will run against. I think if he wins it will show it was rigged again, but that is my opinion
The democratic field is a jumble now. it is unclear how the dems will come up with someone to run against an incumbent.
I agree, there seems like there is already 20 running and I have only heard of like 4 of them. I need to research more. It was so nice chatting with you!
It has been great! Im glad that the system is up again! Have a good evening!
I am too, I hope it lasts! Have a good evening also!
hi, did you vote in the last election?
Hi, how are you? Which election? 2018?
The 2016 one?
Yes, I did vote. Did you vote?
Yes of course. Did you know the indian government put a poll in a forested area full of lions for a single voter?
I guess the gov’t needs to make sure everyone has a chance to vote. The US is different. The voter turnout for presidential elections hasn’t exceeded 62.8% in the last 100 years
I cannot believe more people do not get out and vote, teally
They probably feel that their options are poor. Except in Nevada.Nevada is the only state to have the "none of these candidates" voting option for presidential elections
I like to have that option really. Did you know astronauts vote from space?
I figure they have the right. I wonder what percentage of astronauts actually vote.
Maybe all of them I hope. even in uk not al men had the right to vote until 1918
Maybe you needed to own land, or have a title or something. I wonder if the same rules applied to women.
I am not sure, but glad we all get to vote now. Did you know in atlanta 34% of the black male population cannot vote?
That sounds like the South. I wonder what would happen if a basketball player ran for president.Since 1900, the taller candidate has won the us presidential election 75% of the time.
That is an interesting one. In ancient athens officials were appointed by lottery
I guess they didn’t want rich people to have power. Randomness changes things up.
I guess, but it seems it worked well for them. Do you know much about the planet?
The one that I’m on right now? Sure, I know a few things. 
Well all of them I guess Like that planet where shards of glass precipitate sideways at 4500 mpg on 2000 fahrenehit weather
I think you’d better bring an umbrella. Anyhoo, thanks for the chat!
same here, have a good one
What did you think of the article about the shootings in Parkland
I thought it was very thoughtful and sad about all the mass shootings around in FL and Las Vegas
I thought it was sad too. It’s a shame that people have to resort to shooting students as well as teachers. It’s not even safe to go to school anymore
I wish there could be non-polarizing discussions on it between society and politicians
There needs to be a conversation about it. Maybe it will reach out to people and the shootings will stop. Parents shouldn’t have to worry about what’s going to happen to their children when they send them to school.
I guess it’s important to vote for politicians who care about the people they represent and not lobbyists or the party line
Exactly. All certain politicians care about is money.They don’t care about what is best for people. If they did, things would be better and maybe the violence would end.
Yep, in ancient athens officials were appointed by lottery to avoid an oligarchy
Maybe that should be done here in the U.S. Most likely Trump wouldn’t be in office if the elections was done by lottery.
No, unfortunitly voter turnout hasn’t breached 62.8% in the last 100 years so that may be why the country is in such bad shape
You’re probably right. Some people feel like their vote doesn’t count so they don’t bother. Then again, maybe the taller candidate won as the article claims. That does explain how certain people are elected
I think Nevada has it right with the option "none of the candidates" as a voting option
I think they have it right too. It gives you the option not to vote for people you don’t think are good enough to be in office
People vote for interesting things, Austin TX voted to rename their garbage dump to Fred Durst
They really do. I wonder why they wanted to name it after him. I also wonder why all men couldn’t vote until 1918
I don’t know, I also don’t know why there are polling booths in forests filled of lions in India
I don’t know why there are polling booths like that either. It also never occurred to me that astronauts can vote from space
That’s nuts. Jupiter’s moon ganymede would be considered a planet if it orbited the sun
It is. I find it strange how venus doesn’t have seasons
Yea, Uranus is strange too since it rotates sideways
Exactly. That is very strange. Just like the planet where shards of glass precipitate sideways
Shards of glass and 2000 degree weather, sounds fun
Hi, how are you?
I’m great! How are you?
Well, thanks! How is your smelling ability
It’s pretty good, on par will most. I still can synthesize my own vitamin C.
How is your hearing?
Hearing is pretty good. Like most humans, I have excellent distant running abilities. Well, maybe I used to.
There is a sound frequency that causes fear in humans! That seems weird...
I think it’s 13 hertz, very low, below our threshold of hearing. Causes fear because I think it’s like an earthquake sound.
Reallly??? That’s impressive knowledge! Do you know anything about ribs
I’ve read that they grow back stronger after they get broken, but I haven’t tested that out myself.
Yeah. I know if you smoke them with BBQ sauce for 2 hours on 180 they are delicious...
That a good tip, but they probably won’t heal well after that. 
No, I am not good for the healing portion of ribs. I am on the other side of the healing line. I wonder how many ribs a black swallower fish can eat...
Times times their weight? They would get kicked out of the smorgasbord.
Yeah! They would do some damage... I wonder how they would consume water?
I don’t know whether they are freshwater or saltwater fish. 
That would make the difference. I kknow they do not have necks...
The humble seahorse is the only fish to have a neck. But it’s not immortal!
Is there anything that is immortal, besides Hulk Hogan?
There is a breed of jellyfish that’s immortal. Probably goes by the nickname "Hulk Hogan."
HA! Nice chatting with you!
It is amazing how a certain scent can ellict specific memories from throughout your life isn’t it?
I know, I can catch a faint smell of something and be reminded of something from 20 years ago.
Yes, like a summer rain always reminds me of walking through the woods as a boy.  It’s too bad we can’t replicate those scents and be reminded of our childhood all of the time.
I’ve never thought about it, but I suppose we don’t have names for smells, just where it comes from.
That’s true I refer to a damp basement smell as moldy but why not refer to the smell of onions as ’yuk’?
It’s difficult to imagine having names for each smell, as we have for colors.  I’d think there were too many.
Yes, but imagine if the defining term could relate to the listener not only what the smell was precisely but perhaps even it’s location. Maybe other languages allow for more descriptive labels.
I suppose if you have to survive, partially because of your nose, it makes sense to be very specific.
I would think so. I suppose it has validity to convey something with just one word that lets everyone know everything about it. I think it might be difficult if you were to use a smell word with someone who had never smelled that scent before.
The Semaq Beri speakers take it seriously, especially with the brother and sister thing.  They’d struggle in the city.
Ha! They would indeed. It is funny how different cultures have taboos that make no sense to anyone but them. Whenever I smell a certain perfume I find myself back in time to my school days and the girl I used to love.
I guess we have the ability to use our noses in the same way, we just don’t have the need.  There’s not the peril for us.
True. Not many wild predators around to threaten us. It might be interesting to know their names for smells and try to correlate them into our culture, would they mean the same or not.
It seems it very specific to what you do, like the difference between horticulturists and hunter-gatherers.
Yes, and culture. If I say to you that an object smells like (.......), you would in all likelihood have a very good idea of what I’m referring to based on shared experience.
Avoiding mixing odors seems very extreme, I can’t imagine cooking at home if I have to use different burner for each meat.
That would indeed be a hardship. When I cook I’m always using the simplest most direct way to get fed. A lot of the time that involves a can and one pot.
I wonder what they’d make of some of the exotic cuisines like Indian, Thai or Vietnamese cooking.
They would be adding to their dictionary I think. Some smells give me the willies, like fish. I hate the smell so whenever I walk into someone’s home that has been cooking it I get sick to my stomach, so maybe they are on to something when they don’t mix odors. 
Speaking of fish, did you know there was an immortal jellyfish?
I heard that but wonder how they determined it?
Yeah, I guess there is no way to prove it.  A lot easier to prove a seahorse has  a neck
Yes. Maybe the jellyfish in question regenerates itself constantly so they just infer that it’s immortal.
Another surprising fact is the burning of books by the FDA, I thought the US was against censorship
I did too. What was the subject matter and when did it happen?
I have no idea, I’d guess the thirties or fifties.  Some kinds of novels with problematic themes
Probably of a sexual nature. Many people seem to think that leads to corruption.
Well, it was good speaking to you.
Hello! Do you like to read?
Hi, yes I like to read both Fiction and not fiction, what about you?
I’m into non-fiction more than anything. I wonder what types of books the FDA burned back then.
Wow, they really did a big act of censorship, it was six tons of books
That is one big stack of books! I wish I could have watched the olympic events of literature back in the day!
That is right along with music and painting!! And it was until last centuries!!
That is so crazy! I didn’t even know romantic kissing was a fairly recent development in literature! Where have I been!
Wow, And it was not mentioned frequently in greek literature
Those stories were still amazing though even without that haha. I wonder if they ever wrote about humans losing their body hair 240,000 years ago?
LOL who knows!! but I found crazy that there is  a contest to come up with the worst opening sentence of a novel
I’m sure there have been many dandies! I bet Winston Churchill wasn’t in that since he won a nobel prize in literature.
Yes he did not earn a peace nobel prize!
You would have thought that is what it was for! I sometimes wonder what sound frequency causes fear in us?
Wow, I guess they use those frequencies in suspense and terror movies! but did you know we could re-grow a rib
That is crazy that we can! I wish we could regrow hair lol, and vitamin C but we can’t, but everything else can!
That would be awesome! The rib we could grow in 2 to 3 months, there must be something to regrow hair, we just have to discover it!
I agree! We need to get on the immortal life like a breed of jellyfish is!
That is amazing! and about sea creatures, did you know only the seahorse has a neck?
That is hard to imagine with all of the breeds out there, but very cool! Fish are just crazy!
Did you know that there is a difference how fresh water and salt water fishes drink water?
Isn’t it something with osmosis? I’m going to look more into that. Have a great day!
How familiar are you with the hunting and gathering culture people used to have?
Not too familiar,      Although I’ve read a bit from researcher Nicole Kruspe discussing odor.
Although our sense of smell may not be as developed as some species, odor played an essential role in our survival. However, odor is unique in that people don’t name the specific odor itself, but rather what it reminds us of.
Interesting.   Western scholars dismissed scents as unknowable, or at least unnameable for millenia.
True, but recent studies by Majid found that the Jahai, who are hunter gatherers still, are able to identify these odors by abstract names. It seems that these hunter gathers & horticulturalists can identify odors, unlike the rest of their world due to their unique cirucmstances.
True, Kruspe and Majid propose that, when people settle into, say, horticulture or postindustrial society, other senses become relatively more important than smell. 
McGann states that this ability to distinguish the differences in odor receptors would play a greater role in a more natural, wild environment than the secure urban areas that most horicultural people live. While distinquishing complex smells may save a hunter/gather’s life in the wild, it would be as much a life or death situation in most instances in an urban setting. In fact, simple odors like smelling sulfur are enough for most people to avoid dangerous situations.
Did you know that Humans (taxonomically, Homo sapiens) are the only extant members of the subtribe Hominina.
I recently read that the defining characteristics of Hominina are bipedal locomotion, high dexterity, complex brains, and complex language.
Early hominins‚ particularly the australopithecines, whose brains and anatomy are in many ways more similar to ancestral non-human apes‚ are less often referred to as "human."
True, but because evolutionary development is progressive, it is diffiult to define cleanly where it is apes stop being apes and became humans instead. Considering some of these early hominins were capable of using fire, displaying high intelligence, I believe they should still be consider humans or at least an early precusor.
True, they gave rise to anatomically modern Homo sapiens in Africa about 315,000 years ago
Rather than simply anatomy, I believe the social behaviors and communication is what distinguishes modern human. While most early hominins were capable of using tools, homo sapiens were able to use societys for protection and use their advance communication to capture even the most abstract of concepts for the exponential accumulation and spread of knowledge.
Did you know that If earth’s entire history was viewed as a 24 hour period, humans would only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds.
I only happened upon that information on a Did you know? video. What advantages do you believe allowed us to dominate within this small window in history?
Advantages that explain this evolutionary success include a relatively larger brain with a particularly well-developed neocortex, prefrontal cortex which enable high levels of abstract reasoning and language
Although early hominins have similar adaptations, what do you believe made us stand out and survive while the others didn’t?
A silly one is that Humans are the only mammals that can’t breathe and swallow at the same time
What purpose do you think this serves? Is it to seperate the lungs and stomach to prevent drowning or getting food in the lungs?
Perhaps so, although such adaptaptations would be more likely to occur as gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits came to land.
Speaking of fish, I recently learned that it is negatively labeled as a parphyletic group and not a formal taxonoic group since the classification isn’t as clear as perhaps mammals.
Fish are pretty amazing.      There was a koi fish named hanako that lived for 226 years    Thanks for the chat!
Do you like fish?
Yes, I love fish (at least eating it). I find it funny that freshwater fish only "drink" water through their skin via osmosis, while saltwater fish also drink water through their mouths.
I like to eat them too, and that is funny, have you heard of the black swallower fish before?
Well, I’ve heard that they can eat prey twice their length and ten times their weight, so they must be quite strong. 
I agree and also a scary species, they seem like quite the predator
Yeah, for sure! I also found it interesting that a seahorse is the only fish to have a neck. I didn’t even know it was a kind of fish.
The only one? reallly? that is suprising I though most fish had a neck
Actually, I think what we take for a fish’s neck (I’ve made this mistake also) is not really a neck, but more the area where their gills come out. I find it interesting also that 84 per cent of genes known to be associated with human diseases have counterparts in the zebrafish.
Sounds like a fish we have to study a lot more closely, they can be the solution to many of our health problems and the immortal jellyfish
Yeah, for sure! It’s kind of funny actually, because they said that in humans, that if a human has a rib surgically shortened, that he/she can regrow a rib equally as strong as the original within only 2-3 months.
Humans are just amazing, we adapt for persistnace and we are the best distance runners in all the animal kingdom
Yeah, for sure! Humans do have their downfalls though, because they cannot synthesize their own vitamin c like animals and plants can.
I guess its a great thing we know how to appy science, 
Yeah, for sure! One thing that humans have going for them however is their creativity. Did you know that there is an annual literature contest that challenges writers to come up with the worst possible opening sentence to a novel? That’s really funny. 
I didnt know that, do you like to read? it does sound like a funny contest
Yes, I love reading. It’s kind of funny, because architecture, literature, music, painting and sculptures were olympic events from 1912 until 1952. I don’t know why those would be considered sports, but that is quite interesting.
It is interesting, never considered as sports either, do you know who Winston Churchill was?
Yes, he was the British Prime Minister during WWII and in 1953 he won a nobel prize, ironically though, it was in literature and not peace.
I didnt know him as much of a writter but I haver to read some of his novels and works
Yeah, he sounds like an interesting guy. It’s kind of curious though, because it has been said that romantic kissing is a fairly recent development and is rarely mentioned even in ancient greek literature. How can they explain Romeo and Juliet then? That one had a lot of kissing on the lips.
Yeah one that ended with two deaths and poison, hope you have  a nice night. 
Hi there,, do you have a favorite instrument?
Hi there, I do I love the guitar and the piano. How about you?
Yes I love the piano too. Once the BBC played music as they felt they did not have important news
Wow that is impressive. Freddie Mercury and McCarthy also played piano too
Yeah and they played the same piano once, freedie for bohemian rhapsody and mccarthy for hey jude
Nice that is pretty cool. Have you heard of circus galop?
Yeah that is the stress testing song for pianos that humans cannot play
There is a piano that sits on top of the highest mountain in the UK
Oh that must be the one that the climbers found when they were hiking up there
Yes that is the one. Do you ever shop online, like on Amazon?
I do actually. Did you know Jeff built a clock on a mountain?
Yes and it is supposed to run for 10 000 years. AMazon owns IMDB, pretty cool
They are everywhere now. And they have a deal with US Postal Service to deliver on Sundays
That is so convenient. And their workers seem to be really busy all day long 
Yes they can walk anywhere between 7-15 miles, that is a lot of steps
That sure is. Have you ever bought from AmazonBasics?
I have, I know they are supposed to be on the lower end but I find their stuff to be pretty good too
I agree, it is pretty good. The first guy to buy on amazon got a building named after him
Yes and all he had to do was spend less than $30. What a contribution
Yeah pretty awesome for him. Do you like animals?
I do, my favorite are dogs but I also like others like cats, snakes, elephants and such
Hello Friend, do you like baseball?
Yea, I’m a hugh Yankees fan, I never knew a 17 year old female pitcher once struck out Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig then got banned, sounds like they signed her
Yes, did you know that baseball managers were uniforms because they are technically able to play for their teams if the need arises?
I didn’t know that was the reason why managers wore uniforms but I’ve heard of mangers playing in the game on rare occasions 
Yes, did you also know that a man found $3 Million worth of 1900’s baseball cards in his grandfather’s attic hidden there since the 1940s?
No that’s crazy, I wonder if they had cards of players on the 1908 World Series winning Cubs
That could be.  Did you also know that kickball is also called soccer-baseball in Canada?
No, that’s an odd name. Did you know in baseball if a player catches a ball in their hat  the opposing team gets three bases instead of being out?
That’s cool. Did you know that after the Chicago Cubs won the 2016 World Series, over 5 million people celebrated in the streets, making it one of the largest gatherings in human history?
No but I’m not surprised, it had been 108 years since the Cubs last won a world series
Yes, and the Chicago Cubs were the first baseball team to win back-to-back world series, and didn’t win again until 2016.
I never knew the Cubs used to be named the Orphans, I wonder why they were called that
Not sure but I know that the Chicago Cubs and the Atlanta Braves are the two oldest teams in the major league baseball, both having been founded the same year as the Battle of the Little Bighorn.
Interesting, I never knew the Cubs had pitchers with 4 and 6 fingers on their pitching hand, I wonder if those features gave them an advantage
I’m not sure but in 1945, the Chicago Cubs baseball team was "cursed" when the stadium security wouldn’t let a man named Billy Sianis stay in a World Series stadium with his smelly pet goat.  The cubs did not play in a World Series again until 2016.
Lol, spooky. Did you know that the Dodgers lost the most world series than any other team?
Yes, did you know that as of 2018 the World Series has been contested 114 times?
Yes and the AL has the edge with 66 victories compared to the NL’s 48
Fascinating.  Did you know that in the 1992 World Series that the US Marine Corps color guard carried the Canada flag into the stadium upside down?
Lol no, maybe the US marines were trying to get into the Toronto Blue Jays head
That could be. Nice chatting and have a good night.
Hi, do you like baseball/
Hai. How are you?
Did you know why baseball managers do wear their uniforms during a game?
Yes... same dress code to baseball managers
Yeah, if there is a need they will have to play, I  have never seen that happen!
oh...why are you saw that happen
I did play kickball when i was a child did you play as well?
oh really nice.. I am play football...
Intersting. In canada kickball is called, soccer baseball, I think it makes sense!
yes.. I think sports are giving knowledge.
Did you know baseball is really popular in japan?
yes.. I know.. But i don’t know about baseball. Are you explain about baseball.
Well, baseball is a really fun sport between two teams, the offensive , who are the batters and the defensive who are in the field.
oh...very nice explanation. 
Then the batter team, once they get to hit the ball, they run the bases and If they complete the bases, they score a run
wow...very interesting game. I will try to play baseball.
Yes, i agree is a lot of fun to play baseball and also to watch the world series!
ok... That game was really fun... I am also watch the baseball world series.
it is exciting because it consists of a seven game playoff, so it is not just one night, you get to extend the enjoyment many nights
oh... I definitely play and watch the baseball game. It’s really very interesting... 
Well you are right. I hope you have a nice day!
Have you heard of Doug Harey?
Wasn’t he an umpire for the MLB?
Yes he just died at 87 years of age.
I guess he was a big deal, and he lived quite a while. He’ll be missed though
He must’ve been an interesting character to earn the nick name ’God’.
He was one of those umpires that knew what he was doing
Yup, he earned his spot in the hall of fame after calling 4,673 games.
And five World Series, which is a big leagues in the MLB. He wasn’t intimidated by anyone, it seems
He was around to see some of the first world series that first started in 1903.
That’s incredible! Do you pay attention to baseball much?
No I did when I was younger but lost interest. How bout you?
Every once in a while. It’s one of those sports I would rather play than watch. The Japanese are such big fans of baseball that they would probably take the name "national pastime" from the Americans if they could
Yea they are usually surprised to find so many americans like it too.
Enough that people used to collect baseball cards. One man found a collection in his grandfather’s attic that was worth three million dollars
thats a lot of money. are any managers cards worth anything? they do wear the uniform after all.
Probably only if they step in and play the game. I’ve never seen any of them do it, but that would be an interesting thing to see
I think that would be fun to see, like the cubs winning the championship after 108 years.
It would be fun to see them all play kickball sometime. In Canada, they call the game soccer-baseball
I dont think a couple would schedule all 2430 games throughout 24 years for soccer baseball. like one couple did for baseball.
They might if the game got enough sponsors. They could even play it in extreme conditions like in the snow or on ice. Wearing hockey skates
People would watch it just for the sake of getting together.
Hey how are you doing, ever have problem with the dust fallout while having your wood floors finished?
Never, lol. have you?
I haven’t but if you were wondering, it’s best to clean everything before you do so there is no dust to begin with.
That is a good point, start off on the right foot. I wonder if you can buy products on amazon
I’m sure you can, might be more than $27.95, that was the amount spent by the first customer on Amazon.
I heard that person got a building named after them, that would be awesome, and definitely worth the 28 dollars. I can’t believe Amazon started in 1994
For sure, started as a book store. The USPS has a contract to deliver Amazon packages on Sunday. You think Amazon is getting too big?
I think Amazon has gotten so big, but I think in a good way. I just hope they turn into a monopoly.
For sure, they kind of already are. Or at least selling all that cheap stuff kind of hurts the market overall. The warehouse workers work a ton, between 7 and 15 miles a day they walk.
I couldn’t imagine walking that much per day. I would be in the best shape of my life. Did you know that amazon has another site that sells their returned goods at a discount
I was not aware of that, what it is called? Amazon owns IMDB too, that’s surprising.
I don’t know what it is called, I want to check it out lol. I don’t mind getting an even bigger discount on amazon goods. I wonder why the own imdb
Yah, it’s just out of box stuff usually. Did you know there are no snakes in New Zealand?
New Zealand sounds like the place to be, snakes scare me lol. I don’t get why some snakes give birth and some lay eggs
Yah, they’re pretty messed up, it is interesting to know that the fear of snakes is engrained in our brains.
snakes are crazy lol
Truly, very crazy. I’m surprised Crocodiles are more closely related to bird than snakes and lizards.
I would never have guessed that. I wonder what the relationship is
Not really sure, maybe closer to dinosaurs?
Yea I think that is it, they say dinosaurs had feathers like birds lol, that would be interesting to see for sure!
For sure, it was great chatting with you. I hope you have a good rest of the night, take care!
Are you a fan of baseball?
I am, I love the game! What about you?
I don’t mind it. Do you know why managers wear uniforms?
Yep, because they are technically able to play for their team if the need arises. I don’t recall ever seeing one play though.
That’s correct. I’ve never seen it happen either. 
I’ve heard that up from 1981 until 2005 a married couple actually scheduled all 2,430 major league games played each year.
Wow! That’s some serious devotion to the game. 
Yeah it is. I find it fascinating that baseball is so popular in Japan. I remember watching games when I was stationed there and the crowds were amazing, even for small local games.
I had heard that it was so huge over there that they are surprised that it is our past time. 
Did you ever collect baseball cards?
I did not. How about you?
I collected them with my dad when I was a kid. I wish I could have found a collection like this one man did. He found three million dollars worth of 1900s baseball cards in his grandfather’s attic. They had been hidden since the 1940s.
Wow! That’s amazing. I wish I came across something like that myself. 
Do you know that kickball is called soccer-baseball in Canada? 
I did not. That seems like an overly complicated name. 
Poor Canada though, in the 1992 World Series, Marine Corps color guard carried the Canadian Flag into the stadium upside down.
Oh no! That was a major error. Did you know that until their recent win the last time the Cubs won the world series the Ottoman Empire still existed?
Yep that was such a huge win for them. I heard over 5 million people celebrated in the streets!
I can see why. They were also the first team to win back-to-back world series but then didn’t win again until the recent one which was a huge gap in between wins. 
The team was supposedly cursed in 1945 when stadium security wouldn’t let a man named Billy Sianis bring his goat into the stadium.
That is a very strange superstition for them to have. It was nice chatting with you. Have a lovely night. 
How’s it going, do you follow baseball? The Nationals recently traded Daniel Murphy and Matt Adams to the Cubs
I don’t follow baseball much, but I do think I heard something recently in the news about how the Cubs won over the Phillies? It’s so confusing when they trade players for me to follow!
Yea, I guess the manager Martinez isn’t doing too good in Washington and traded them away
I think the Cubs have been having a lot of trouble with their player’s health. I hope they can turn it around and have a good season!
Maybe, but the Cubs haven’t been too lucky since they started in 1903
I think I’ve heard about that...are they the team that one back to back and then haven’t won another World Series since then?
The Cubs didn’t win until 2016, they beat the Royals I believe 
Oops meant won not one. I remember a long time ago they lost in a famous World Series game to the White Sox. I’m glad they won recently, as it’s been a long time!
Yea, When the Cubs won 5 million people celebrated in the street, they have been waiting a long time
I bet that was one of the best baseball celebrations ever! I heard that Ronald Regan was a broadcaster for the Cubs in the thirties. He had a very interesting life!
Yea, wonder if he called the infamous Billy Goat game
How do you play that? I heard that when the Cubs first started playing baseball they were the Chicago Orphans. I wonder what the story behind that is, though?
I don’t know, the Cubs were founded the same year as the Battle of Little Bighorn so maybe it has something to do with the times
That’s a fun fact! I also hear they’re called the North Siders because of where Wrigley Field is and The White Sox has their field on the South Side of Chicago. Have you ever been there?
No but I’d love to visit Wrigley field, it is one of the most historic baseball parks
I hear that it’s a really nice place and the culture is cool there too. In example, when the visitors hit a homer into the bleachers the cubs fans throw it back into the field! lol I’d like to see that.
THat’s pretty crazy. I heard Japan has a crazy baseball culture too and are shocked to find out baseball is America’s pasttime
I’ve heard of that and wonder what the food is like at a Japanese baseball game. Do you think they’d serve both sushi and hot dogs?
Probably, I wonder if Japan has baseball cards like in the US, a guy once found 3 million dollars worth in his grandfathers attic
That sounds like a really cool find, especially if you know the right baseball card collectors. I think I’m gonna go collect some dinner. TTYL!
Have a good one
Hi there! How’s it going? Are you a baseball fan?
Hi. I’m doing very well thanks. I’m do watch baseball on occasion and I’m a casual fan.
Do you root for a specific team? Long-time Yankee fan over here.
You probably won’t like this but I’m Red Sox fan. I heard that Eric Hosmer signed with the San Diego Padres  for $144 million in an eight year contract.
Haha you’re right I don’t like the Red Sox. Yes I believe the Hosmer contract was last year. I think that’s going to end up being a bad contract.
Me too. I think its too much money for a player that has proven himself. He is a 28 years old and he plays in the first base position and he did very well as a Royal.
By the end of that deal he will be in his mid to late 30’s and nowhere ear as good. Definitely an overpay. Not as crazy as those Machado and Harper deals for over 300 million though.
No nothing like that. He has won 4 Gold Gloves in his career and I will like to see him in a Red Sox uniform.
That’s true the Red Sox only weakness now is 1st base. Who’s their starting, Mitch Moreland?
You are correct. I also heard that Hosmer will be making $20 million over each of the first 5 seasons with the Padres.
That’s smart to front load it. It’s crazy how much these guys get to play baseball. It’s not even as physically demanding as football, basketball or hockey.
I agree with you completely. Those sports are way more physical than baseball. Did you know that the Dodgers have lost more world series championships than any other baseball team?
They’ve been around so long, it makes sense. I think they lost a lot of them to the Yankees. It’s funny prior to the cubs just winning recently the last time they won before that the Ottoman Empire still existed.
Ha Ha!! The Dodgers are bad. They were crushed by the Red Sox
I hate how good Mookie Betts is. I think the Yankee’s will give the Red Sox a run for their money this year though.
I believe that to be the case. The Yankees are very talented club and always gave a hard time to the Red Sox whether we played them here or at Yankees.
Have you been to Fenway Park? I actually saw a game there on a trip to Boston. It’s a really cool stadium.
I have been to Fenway Park a few times and its really nice and especially when we play against the Yankees. I think the Padres will be fine because their ownership is investing .
Well I don’t know if you heard, but the Padres did just sign Manny Machado this year. I think his contract was like 300 million for 10 years.
You’re correct. They are building the team and I think they will do well in the long term but as far as them making it to the World Series, I’m not too sure about that.
I don’t think they have the pitching yet. That’s so important for winning the World Series. Anyway it was nice chatting with you, enjoy the rest of your day!
You’re correct. It all comes down to exceptional pitching to make it to the World Series. I was very nice chatting with you today as well. Have a nice day!!!
Take care.
hello, do you watch baseball?
I do, it is my favorite sport. Do you watch? 
I watch it from time to time. Do you know why the managers wear uniforms?
I think they are technically allowed to play. 
Yeah, good for them, do you know what kickball is called in Canada?
No, do you play kickball? I did for fun a few years ago. 
I do not play it but apparently in Canada it is called soccer-baseball
Awesome, I’ve only been to Canada once. Have you been? 
Yes, I have friend there so I go all the time. Nice country and nice people
Awesome. Did you know Baseball is super popular in Japan? 
Yeah and they cannot believe that in the US is just a pastime?
yeah, that’s awesome. The Cubs were the first team to win back to back world series. 
Nice, good for them. Do you know who used to do the schedule for major baseball laegue
No, do you? Apparently the Ottoman Empire was still in existence when the Cubs won the world series. 
Oh wow that means it goes way back then. Yeah it was a couple who did it for 24 years
Yeah, that is crazy. Apparently the cubs had a player with 6 fingers, doesn’t seem possible. 
Wow, that is so interesting indeed. Did you know the women’s cup had higher ratings than the world series?
I can believe it. Some of the games can be boring if you aren’t a fan. 
That is very true. When the CUbs won in 2016, 5 million people celebrated i the streets
Wow, that must have made a huge mess. They were the first team to win it back to back, but then didn’t win again until 2016. 
And the largest in history. Nice chatting with you.
Hi.  Can you play the piano?
I can play some, I have an electric piano that I keep plugged in in my room.
Thats really cool, I can play a bit, but spend more time with other instruments.  Did you know Freddie Mercury used the same piano for Bohemian Rhapsody that McCartney used for Hey Jude in the recording studio?
That’s really cool. I wish the news would play piano instead of news these days like they did back in 1930.
I know. It would be far better than the slanted views they all put out today.  Id actually enjoy that.
Do you like Amazon? I have Amazon prime video and it with Netflix is all I really use for tv these days.
I love amazon!  Love how quickly they can get things out, even on sundays
Maybe I should get a job in one of the Amazon warehouses, sounds like a good idea to lose some extra weight since they walk 7 to 15 miles per day!
That might be a good gig for me too, trying to up my step game.  
I would love to visit the clock in the mountain that Jeff Bezos had built.
That would be cool.  It is going to run for 10,000 years so youve got time.
So how do you feel about snakes? I have a pet king snake myself, and I love them.
